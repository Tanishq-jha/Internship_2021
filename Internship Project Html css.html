            <p>AITR has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies. CSIT department @ AITR has three
                courses those include the emerging areas as recommended by the AICTE committee. As exponential growth in
                information on various platforms, future engineers must have the expertise in core computer science as
                well as latest technologies. It requires blending of emerging areas with core subject and therefore
                AICTE introduced as new branch CSIT.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The courses @ CSIT incorporate both theory and practicals/labs in the emerging areas of AI, ML, IoT,
                Blockchain and Data Sciences as core subjects and Quantum Computing, Virtual Reality and Cyber Security
                as Professional Electives. The above emerging areas have been identified by the national level committee
                as part of National Perspective Plan for Engineering Education and accepted by AICTE. AICTE has also
                prescribed the model curriculum for the above emerging areas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The course @ CSIT is in the AICTE nomenclature and accepted by them as equivalent to CSE and IT. The
                courses bring the best of both CSE and IT together. The course @ CSIT will be accepted as being similar
                / relevant to CSE and IT and will also be accepted for campus recruitments, not only in private
                companies but also in government undertakings etc. The graduates of the courses @ CSIT will be accepted
                even for any faculty recruitments for the departments of CSE or IT or CSIT. The graduates will also be
                eligible for higher education (both in India and abroad).</p>
